    "## Notes on Efficiency for Large PDFs\n",
    "\n",
    "Processing very large PDF files (e.g., 50+ pages, especially if they are scanned and require OCR for many pages) can be time-consuming and memory-intensive.\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Page-by-Page Processing**: The current `extract_text_from_pdf` function processes page by page. For OCR, each page is converted to an image and then processed. This is inherently sequential for a single call.\n",
    "*   **Memory**: Storing all extracted text in memory might be an issue for extremely large documents. If you encounter `MemoryError`, consider modifying the scripts to process data in chunks or stream to a file, though this adds complexity.\n",
    "*   **OCR Speed**: Tesseract OCR speed depends on image quality, resolution, language, and system resources. Pre-processing images (e.g., binarization, noise removal) can sometimes help but is not implemented here.\n",
    "*   **Timeout**: Very long OCR processes might lead to timeouts in some environments.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Potential Optimizations (Advanced)**:\n",
    "*   **Selective OCR**: The current `pdf_parser` already attempts direct text extraction first, which is good. For mixed PDFs, this avoids unnecessary OCR.\n",
    "*   **Parallel Processing**: For PDFs with many scanned pages, one could parallelize the OCR of individual pages using Python's `multiprocessing` or `concurrent.futures` libraries. This would require changes to `pdf_parser.py` to:\n",
    "    *   Split the PDF into individual pages (or ranges of pages).\n",
    "    *   Create a pool of worker processes.\n",
    "    *   Each worker would OCR its assigned page(s).\n",
    "    *   Collect and correctly order the results.\n",
    "*   **Image Pre-processing for OCR**: For scanned documents, image pre-processing like deskewing, binarization, or noise removal might improve OCR accuracy and speed. Libraries like OpenCV can be used for this.\n",
    "*   **Downsampling High-Resolution Images**: If scanned pages are at a very high resolution (e.g., >300-600 DPI), downsampling them before OCR might speed up the process with minimal accuracy loss. This needs careful tuning.\n",
    "*   **Alternative OCR Engines**: While Tesseract is powerful and free, other engines (some commercial, some cloud-based like Google Cloud Vision AI, AWS Textract) might offer better performance, accuracy, or language support for specific use cases.\n",
    "*   **Caching**: If the same documents are processed repeatedly, caching extracted text could save significant time.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook provides a foundational approach. For production-scale processing of very large or complex documents, implementing some of these optimizations and conducting thorough performance testing would be crucial.\n"
